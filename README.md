# Pakistani-Coin-Adder
Object Localization &amp; Image Recognition of Pakistani Coins

This project combines the domains of Digital Image Processing and Signal Processing to first synthesize and process pictures of Pakistani Coins and then through image recognition, calculate their total value.
It was done to complete the requirements of my course project for Digital Image Processing and is a first of its kind to since the techniques used such as Otsu Threshold, while previously largely used for foreign coins, were employed on Pakistani coins for the first time. 
This is taken through inspiration from Introduction to Data, Signal, and Image Analysis with MATLAB, a course by Vanderbilt University.
